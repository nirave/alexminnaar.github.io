<p>Stanford has released an interesting <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html">sentiment analysis tool</a> as part of their great <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml">CoreNLP package</a>.  It is based on a recursive deep learning model that takes into account the semantic structure of the entire sentence rather than simply summing the positive and negative sentiments of the words that appear in it.  This idea is very promising.  Clearly a sentence's structure contains a lot of usefull information that could be used for determining its sentiment. Unfortunately, it has a few drawbacks which prevent it from being my sentiment analyzer of choice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training Data:</strong>  The out-of-the-box sentiment model that this tool comes with was trained using the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html">Sentiment Treebank</a> dataset which is composed of 9,645 sentences.  If you look at some of these sentences you will quickly see that they are very well structured in terms of spelling and grammatical correctness.  In contrast, most social media text is not so well structured (eg. misspellings, grammar mistakes, abbreviations, slang, emoticons etc.).  Obviously, if the data with which you train your model is different from the data on which you apply that model, you cannot expect to observe good performance.</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-Vocabulary Words:</strong>  This drawback is closely related to the previous one.  Oftentimes sentences contain words that are <em>out-of-vocabulary</em> (sometimes called OOV words) which are words that are not contained in your dictionary of known words (eg. misspellings, rare words, slang etc.).  It is very difficult to build a semantic model of of a sentences structure if it contains OOV words.  It is very possible that one word could change a sentence's structure entirely and if that word is OOV it is very likely that your structure model could be wrong.  For this reason, a sentiment model based on sentence structure could be problematic.</li>
<li><strong>Tokenization:</strong>  Stanford's sentiment analysis tool makes use of the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.shtml">Stanford Tokenizer</a>.  A major problem with the Stanford tokenizer is that it almost always tokenizes emoticons incorrectly.  For example, it will split the classic smiley emoticon ":)" into a ":" token followed by a separate ")" token.  Obviously emoticons can convey a great deal of information regarding sentiment (particulary in short sentences such as tweets) so ignoring them is a big problem.</li>
</ul>
